# Review of data scienece books available on Amazon

Suppose you are an analyst and your manager has asked you to analyze all data science books available and sold by Amazon. You especially want to understand more about the ratings and price for these books. A lot of times, product information is kept in separate tables in your database. Therefore, we need to join those tables together before we do any further analysis. Your task in this assignment is to get the data ready for visualization and analysis by filtering for only the books that have ratings. You also want to include the price detail for these books if available.
